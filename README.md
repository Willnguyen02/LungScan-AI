# LungScan-AI

LungScan AI is an innovative project focused on leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to perform binary classification of lung X-ray images. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between healthy lungs and those affected by pneumonia. Pneumonia, a serious respiratory condition, often requires quick and precise diagnosis, and traditional methods can be time-consuming and subject to human error. The use of deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs, offers a promising solution to automate and enhance the accuracy of pneumonia detection from X-ray images.

This project builds on the growing field of medical image analysis, where CNNs have shown significant promise in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and feature extraction. By applying these techniques to chest X-rays, LungScan AI aims to reduce diagnostic time and support healthcare professionals in making more informed decisions. Through the implementation of this system, we aim to create a tool that can be integrated into clinical settings, improving the efficiency of pneumonia detection and potentially saving lives through early diagnosis.

In the following sections, this thesis will detail the methodology used to train and evaluate the CNN model, the dataset employed for training, and the performance metrics used to assess the model's effectiveness.
